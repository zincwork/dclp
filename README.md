ENS Hackathon (Team DCLP)

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

OVERVIEW
The DCLP (Decentralised LastPass) project replicates core functionality from LastPass (password storage) application in a decentralised manner, securely storing a user's login usernames and passwords on the blockchain & IPFS

DATA STORED

    <ENS_ID> -  (e.g.) peterbrooke.dclp.eth
    <APPLICATION_NAME> - (e.g.) gmail

    password.<APPLICATION-NAME>.<ENS_ID> > encrytped(password)
    username.<APPLICATION-NAME>.<ENS_ID> > username
    url.<APPLICATION-NAME>.<ENS_ID> > www.gmail.com

ENCRYPTION SCHEME
T.B.C

ENS_ID
ENS_ID (e.g. peterbrooke.dclp.eth) points to the DCLP autogenerated ethereum account

EXTENSION 

Functionality
a. The extension uses a password so the user can access it
b. The extension has a set of hard-code url/username/passwords initially
c. The user's ENS_ID & password is set the first time the extension is launched (hardcoded for th first version?)
d. The extension displays a list of urls that it can log into automatically
 
Operation
1. If a user types a site URL into a browser, the extension 
  a. Checks if the user is already logged into that site, and if they are logged in the extension does nothing
  b. If the user is not logged in, the extension checks if the login credentials for that URL i.e. URL.<APPLICATION-NAME>.<ENS_ID> exists on the blockchain
  c. If the blockchain does have the password URL, then the username & password for that URL are retrieved 
  d. If blockchai does not have credentials for that domain, it does nothing (for now, eventually it will prompt the user to add the URL credentials)

2. If the extension has retrieved site credentials it fills in the username/password fields and auto 'presses' the login button
a. If the login fails the extension prompts the suser to update thelogin credentials (future functionailty)
